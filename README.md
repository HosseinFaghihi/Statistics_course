# Student Performance and NumPy Statistics Project

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing student performance data and performing statistical analysis using NumPy. The project is divided into two main parts: statistical analysis of student performance data and test numpy functions.

## Project Overview

### Part 1: Student Performance Data Analysis
In this part, we analyze a dataset containing information about student performance. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, visualizations, and insights into factors affecting student performance.


### Part 2: Statistics with NumPy
This part of the project focuses on using the NumPy library to perform various statistical computations. It demonstrates how to leverage NumPy's powerful functions for efficient data analysis.

For each Numpy function:

- Implement the function using basic Python constructs.
- Implement the function using Numpy.
- Compare the outputs of both implementations to ensure they match.
